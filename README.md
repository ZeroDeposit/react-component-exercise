# React Component Exercise

Create a reusable React component based on the date picker designs below.

![date picker](date-picker-blank.png "Date Picker")
![date picker with input](date-picker-input.png "Date Picker with input")

The aim of this exercise is to test your knowledge of React, so we have provided example HTML and CSS in [input.html](input.html).

Instructions
------------
- Create an input component
- Create a parent component which uses the input component 3 times
- Commit all code to a git repository which you'll share with us
- Provide README instructions on how to set the project up
- Provide a URL where we can see the component in the browser online

Tips
----
- Set-up your project as you normally would with React. If you use `create-react-app` or a custom set-up that's fine
- If you would normally use automated testing then please add this
- Bear in mind we'll be building ontop of this work
- Think about the functionality we'd want to use this component in a real world project
